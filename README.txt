My very first personal project using Python. 

--------------------------------------------
Created using the package BeautifulSoup. This implementation scrapes the newegg website for all its available Nvidia Graphics cards.
Collects data on brand, price, product name, shipping costs and product link and exports them to a .csv file.

Please modify this code as you wish!
