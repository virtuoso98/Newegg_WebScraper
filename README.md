# Newegg NVIDIA Graphics Card Webscraper

My first mini-project that uses Python and BeautifulSoup4. As an avid graphics card enthusiast, I decided to implement code that  scrapes the newegg website for all its available Nvidia Graphics cards. It collects data on brand, price, product name, shipping costs and product link and exports them to a .csv file.

Fel free to use this as when you wish!
